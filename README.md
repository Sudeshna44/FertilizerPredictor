# Development of an AI Based Fertilizer Prediction System

Fertilizer prediction is foundational for sustainable agriculture, optimizing resource use to enhance productivity while promoting environmental and economic health. This AI-powered Fertilizer Prediction System leverages machine learning to recommend optimal fertilizer types and predict soil moisture based on various crop and soil conditions. By processing inputs like soil type, crop type, and nutrient levels, the system delivers precise recommendations to maximize crop yield and ensure balanced nutrient management.

This solution is built using machine learning models in Python, hosted via Flask, and connected to a MySQL database through Spring Boot, ensuring seamless data handling and integration. The Flask API processes requests and performs predictions in real-time, while Spring Boot manages robust backend operations and database interactions. Integrating AI with agricultural practices ensures that resources are utilized effectively, promoting balanced nutrient management and enhancing crop yield.
